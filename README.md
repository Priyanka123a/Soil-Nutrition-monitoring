This Arduino project implements a Soil Nutrition Monitoring and Control System, providing real-time data on soil and environmental conditions while automating irrigation control. The key features include:

Sensor Readings:

Soil Moisture: Measures the moisture level of the soil.
Temperature and Humidity: Monitors ambient temperature and humidity.
Nutrients (NPK): Measures nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in the soil.
LCD Display:

A 16x2 LCD shows real-time sensor readings, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and NPK levels, in a rotating display.
Water Pump Control:

Automatically turns on a water pump (indicated by an LED) if soil moisture falls below a predefined threshold.
Buzzer Alert:

Activates a buzzer to alert users when soil moisture is critically low.
IoT Integration with Blynk (Optional):

Includes placeholders for integrating the project with the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control.
